**Working prototyp Version 0.5**

# Description
The idea was born because my dad always measured the chlorine content and pH value by hand. This means small tablets that change colour on contact with the water. With this you could estimate how much you have to add to bring the values back to the optimal range.  Unfortunately this is not very efficient and accurate. Hence this small project with an esp32 and the Internet of Things.
A small project that takes care of your pool and informs you how your pool is doing. That means you get information about chlorine content, pH-value, conductivity of the water and more.. .

**still in process and receive changes**
